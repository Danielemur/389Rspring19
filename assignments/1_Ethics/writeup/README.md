## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (25 pts)

This was done via the [ELMS assignment](). (we'll post an announcement when this is ready!)

### Part 2 (75 pts)

In this scenario, my boss should be told immediately before any other party, for two reasons.
I have a responsibility as an employee to inform him of my findings.
As my boss, he may have additional knowledge about how the problem should be addressed that I may not.
Moreover, from a logistics standpoint, I would want any potential work on fixing this problem to begin as soon as possible, so alerting my boss right away is the best first action.

There are a number of interdependent factors which would influence the best course of action beyond that.
One important considerations is the likelihood that a potential attacker is already aware of the vulnerabilities.
It is possible that no one currently knows of the vulnerabilities, and that they would not be discovered prior to being patched.
In this case, publishing information on the vulnerabilities might actually cause more harm than otherwise by alerting malicious agents to the presence of the weakness, prompting them to exploit it.

This likelihood of attacker knowledge is incredibly difficult to estimate, however, as many real-world attacks have been carried out that leverege vulnerabilities which might otherwise seem far to convoluted to discover.
Even an attack vector as absurd as row hammering has been shown to be expolitable in crafting an attack.

One possible solution, depending on the specifics of the case, might be to publish enough general information about the vulnerabilities to allow the public to protect themselves, while not giving away enough technical information to lead potential attackers directly to the weak points.
This may not be possible, however, and even if it were, the mere announcement of the existance of the vulnerabilities might be enough to prompt a malicious agent to discover the vulnerabilities.

In general, however, the strategy of "security by obscurity" is often a poor choice.
There are numerous examples of companies such as Google and Uber actively covering up data breaches which put customers at risk.
This may be both out of a combination of protecting the public image of the companies, as well as a misguided attempt to "protect" the consumer by keeping other attackers from learning about the leaks.

Inaction in this case places responsibility for any harmful outcomes squarely on the soulders of any party with knowledge of the vulnerability, including myself.
Given the magnitude of the potential harm, I would ultimately decide to make the information public.
If the company were unwilling to do this itself, then I would likely choose to release it by way of a consumer watchdog.
This may place me in potential legal trouble due to possible non-disclosure agreements.
Nevertheless, human life should be prioritized over both company image, and my own legal wellbeing.
